### The Problem

For as long as I could remember, I  avoided the kitchen at all costs. Alas, when I finally moved to NYC, I thought I found my utopia in services like Seamless and Grubhub!! However, after eating the same cold, soggy noodles each and every night (not to mention my hemorrhaging bank balance) I decided to make a change.

After many hours watching cooking shows like Binging with Babish, I was finally ready to start my culinary journey. Since becoming a novice chef, I started to notice trends in the way dishes were prepared. Dish too spicy, add some sweetness. Dish too rich, cut it with some acidity. I noticed that in different regional cuisine styles, although different ingredients were used, the effects were largely the same. So, to explore this further, I decided to make an app, Recipe2Style with the goal of transferring any dish into the style of a different regional cuisine.
